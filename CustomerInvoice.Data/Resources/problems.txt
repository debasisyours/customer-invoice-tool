Hi, 

Just wanted you let you know few things and seek your opinion.

We faced/ are facing few problems after we came here. Some of these have already been addressed and some are yet to be done.

1. Carpenter related issues: door of the washroom in the first floor can not be closed/opened as the wood is swelled and there is no handle from inside.  This was reported in the beginning

2. Electric related issues: 
    A. There is no light in the first floor utility. This was reported in the beginning.
    B. Dual-mode switching does not work in front-facing second floor room light. This was reported in the beginning.
    C. Both fan and light switches are not working in the bedroom in first floor. This happened after 10-15 days we came.

3. Plumbing issues:
    A. The outlet in the kitchen sink was broken the very next day we came in and the valve had to be repired immediately. We did this ourselves (repair cost was 500).
    B. Tap water flow is getting reduced in the first floor washroom (may be due to rust sediment depositing in the outlet). This is slowly cropping up day by day.

4. Welding issues:
    Few days back (November first week), the handle in the terrace iron door got broken. As it was an emergency issue, we got it fixed immediately (repair cost was 1200).

5. Chimney issue:
    While coming in, we requested to get the kitchen chimney inside ducts cleaned.

We are letting you know about these problems as these happened immediately after we came in. Obviously, going further we will take these kind of things going forward. But, for now, please let us know how should we go about fixing these.
